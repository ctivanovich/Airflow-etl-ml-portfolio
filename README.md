# Airflow-etl-ml-portfolio
This a portfolio containing Airflow, ETL DAGs, ML notebook tasks, Dockerfiles, SQL schema files, and more.

The layout is as follows:

/airflow

  --> airflow/
      --> dags: containing DAG definition files
          --> modules: containing support code, in abidance with the principle that DAG files should primarily contain DAG definitions, not functions.

/docker

/nb_production
